# Test MOS ROM

This is a test MOS ROM to test the basic functionality of the Z80 processor plugin. It is similar to the [Tricky OS Test Rom](https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?t=10268) in that it should continue to run even if the memory of the machine in question is not functioning. However, the functionality is more limited - the purpose is to confirm that the z80 processor is running rather than testing out the BBC's hardware.
